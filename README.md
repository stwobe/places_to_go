# Title: places to go!
# Sub-title: "Hidden Places"

# About: This site is going to store all the cool, hidden places to explore

This website is going to be a dynamic list of cool, hidden places to go. The end goal is a source that will be useful for myself - if I want to go somewhere cool, I can just use my site - click on a place and keep clicking until you've found the place you want. Or just type and the result will pop up (like MongoDB style, so I may have to convert to Mongo at some point).

When you get to the page (or view, in Django speak, I guess) that you want, you will be presented with a multimedia page - information, photos, videos and "audios". The video could be drone based. The photos may be old one I've taken or new ones IO've taken with this site in mind.

Initially, it will be local but there is nothing stopping this from going much further afield.

At first (the first phase), it's just a very rough HTML list of the first places that I could think of. But then I am adding new places to it, whenever I think of or find another place.

The second phase is going to be using Python, in particular the Django framework. This will add a dynamic element to the site. So, there will be just a short list of the top level places. You click on one, then you go the next level of detail, and keep on clicking until you get to the actual place you awant (as mentioned above).

Later phases will add the search box and the ability to sort by other things such as distance or activities (instead of just location). Also,m later phases will bring in the photos, videos, information and audio (as mentioned previously)

It will probably end up looking like Pinterest. So each link would have one image displayed underneath it, whichever level you're at.
